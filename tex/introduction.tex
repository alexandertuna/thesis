This thesis documents the evidence of Higgs boson decays to tau leptons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Special emphasis is given to the VBF $\Htautaulh$ subset of the analysis.

\cref{chap:standardmodel} gives a description of the Standard Model of particle physics to provide theoretical context for searches for the Higgs boson. \cref{chap:lhcatlas} describes the LHC and the ATLAS detector, which are the experimental apparatuses used here. \cref{chap:taus} describes tau leptons and their experimental signatures at ATLAS.

\cref{chap:strategy} describes the strategy for searching for $\Htautau$ at ATLAS. \cref{chap:backgrounds} reviews how physics processes relevant to the search are predicted, with special emphasis given to mis-identified $\tauh$. \cref{chap:results} gives the results of the searches. \cref{chap:prospects} concludes this thesis with a discussion of future prospects for $\Htautau$ analysis at ATLAS, both in the near- and long-term.
