% This thesis presents evidence for Higgs decays to tau leptons with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Special emphasis is given to the VBF $\Htautaulh$ category of the analysis. The data correspond to $25\ \ifb$ of proton collisions with $\sqrt{s} = $ 7 or 8 TeV. Particle reconstruction at ATLAS is discussed, with additional detail given to hadronic tau lepton decays. The $\Htautau$ search strategy, predictions, and results are described. Prospects for the $\Htautau$ analysis, both in the near- and long-term, are also discussed.
