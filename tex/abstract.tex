This thesis presents a review of the evidence for Higgs decays to tau leptons with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider with the Run-I dataset. Special emphasis is given to the VBF $\Htautaulh$ category of the analysis. Particle reconstruction, search strategy, predictions, and results are described. Prospects for the $\Htautau$ analysis, both in the near- and long-term, are also discussed.
